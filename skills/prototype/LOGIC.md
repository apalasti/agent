# Logic Prototype

A single, self-contained HTML file (a **shareable demo**) that lets anyone drive a state model by clicking buttons. Use this when the question is about **business logic, state transitions, or data shape**: the kind of thing that looks reasonable on paper but only feels wrong once you push it through real cases.

Because it's one file with nothing to install, you can hand it to a non-developer (a designer, a PM, a domain expert) and let them feel the model for themselves. So it speaks their language, not the code's.

If the question is "what should this look like," this is the wrong branch. Use [UI.md](UI.md).

## Process

### 1. State the question

Before writing code, write down what state model and what question you're prototyping. One paragraph, at the top of the demo (in a visible intro, not just a comment). A logic prototype that answers the wrong question is pure waste, so make the question explicit so it can be checked later, whether the user is watching now or returning to it AFK.

### 2. Isolate the logic in a pure module

Put the actual logic (the bit that's answering the question) in a single `<script>` block written as a small, pure module, so the rules it encodes can be read and stated on their own, apart from the page.

The right shape depends on the question:

- **A pure reducer**: `(state, action) => state`. Good when actions are discrete events and state is a single value.
- **A state machine**: explicit states and transitions. Good when "which actions are even legal right now" is part of the question.
- **A small set of pure functions** over a plain data type. Good when there's no implicit current state, just transformations.
- **A class or module with a clear method surface** when the logic genuinely owns ongoing internal state.

Pick whichever shape best fits the question being asked, *not* whichever is easiest to wire to a page. Keep it pure: no DOM, no `document`, no button handlers reaching inside it. The page calls into it; nothing flows the other direction. This is what makes the prototype useful past its own lifetime: once the question's answered, the states, transitions and rules can be read straight off the module and written down.

### 3. Build the shareable HTML file

One file, plain HTML/CSS/JS: no framework, no bundler, no server, everything inline so it opens by double-click and survives being emailed around.

Write it for a non-developer. Every label is in **domain language**, not code: buttons and state read like the business, not the reducer. Explain in plain words what's happening.

Lay it out with a clean hierarchy, top to bottom:

1. **Title and one-line explanation** of what this demo lets you explore (the question from step 1).
2. **Current state**: the full relevant state, rendered as a readable panel (labelled fields, not a raw JSON dump), re-rendered after every click so the change is visible. Where it helps a non-developer follow, call out what just changed.
3. **Free-play buttons**: one button per action, always available, so anyone can poke at the model in any order. Each click dispatches its action and re-renders the state.
4. **Guided walkthroughs**: a set of **scenarios**, one per tab. Each tab holds a short plain-language description of the scenario (the situation it sets up and what to watch for) and underneath it, the ordered **buttons to press** for that scenario. Each step is a real button: clicking it performs that action and moves to the next step. Starting a walkthrough resets to a known initial state so the scenario runs the same way every time.

Choose scenarios that demonstrate the awkward cases, the ones hard to reason about on paper: the happy path, a tricky edge case, an attempt at something that should be illegal.

Keep it beautiful but restrained: clean typography, generous spacing, one accent colour. No animations, no gimmicks: nothing that competes with the state and the buttons.

### 4. Hand it over

Send them the file, or open it for them. They'll click through the walkthroughs and free-play whenever they get to it; the interesting moments are when they say "wait, that shouldn't be possible" or "huh, I assumed X would be different"; those are the bugs in the _idea_, which is the whole point. If they want new actions or a new scenario, add them. Prototypes evolve.

### 5. Capture the answer and the prototype

Once the prototype has answered its question, capture the answer, then capture the prototype the way the [SKILL](SKILL.md) describes. The logic-specific mapping: the decision is the states, transitions and rules the walkthroughs proved, written into the issue in those terms, and the real module is written fresh from them. The test for that write-up: an implementer can write the module from the issue without opening the demo. Then the whole file, module and shell alike, rides along to the throwaway branch that keeps the prototype as a primary source, and being one self-contained file, it stays trivially re-runnable there.

## Anti-patterns

- **Generalising.** No "what if we wanted to support X later." The prototype answers one question.
- **Porting the module into production.** It was written to be clicked through, under prototype constraints. Build the real module from the written-down rules.
