Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Format a round like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>

---

❓ **Q2** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. Before asking a question, name what it takes for granted: how the code behaves today, what already exists, what something would cost. Each of those you have not read in the code is an unsettled prerequisite: dispatch a sub-agent to check it, and hold the question until it reports. A question built on an unchecked assumption is not a decision; it is your guess handed to the user to own. Questions whose prerequisites are all settled go out now, without waiting.

When the facts alone decide the answer, don't ask: state the answer with its evidence and let the user veto it. Ask only where it is genuinely a preference or a trade-off the facts leave open, and then give the user the facts they need to choose. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
